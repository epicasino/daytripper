## Installation

[LIVE DEPLOYMENT IN HEROKU](https://daytripper-app-1577e78f3877.herokuapp.com/)

If you want to locally deploy the web application:

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) installed on your computer.
2. Download the repository onto your computer, and extract it to a directory of your choosing.
3. In your preferred command-line application (Git Bash, Terminal, etc.), `cd` onto your directory and type `npm i` to download the needed dependencies for the web application.
4. Because this application uses the Google Platforms API, you will need to create an environment variable for the token key.

## Usage

Upon first accessing the application, you will be greeting with the homepage.
